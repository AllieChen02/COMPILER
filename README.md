# Compiler Construction

## Lab Goals
- lab1: Using flex and bison for DEMO language
- lab2: Use the bison parser generator to build an abstract syntax tree (AST) for an input DemoSub program. Based on the AST constructed, write an interpreter in C to execute the program.

## Lab 1 - Running
1. make parser
2. make demo
3. ./demo <file name>

## Lab 2 - Running
1. make clean
2. make demo
3. ./demo <file name>
